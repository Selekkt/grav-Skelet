# Hallo Daar!!!
This is a HTML5 & CSS boilerplate example page with all the base elements you need to start creating your next project. <a href="docs.html">SkÄ“let documentation</a>

#### Get started!
Manually copy the files from `user/themes/skelet/_demo/pages` to `user/pages`
<hr>

#### Multiple Editors
If you set `Page Template` to 'Portfolio' instead of 'Item' you'll get Multiple editors
<hr>

#### Modular Pages
If you moved the `user/themes/skelet/_demo/pages` to `user/pages` you'll now have a Modular page set.

TL;DR: with Modular pages you can call all the info from these pages in one-page layout for example.
"About from modular" gets its data from the "About" inside Modular.
